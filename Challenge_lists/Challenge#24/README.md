Challenge #24: Run a simulation on the EBRAINS BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic 
hardware 
EBRAINS  (https://www.ebrains.eu)  is  an  open  research  infrastructure  that  gathers  data,  tools  and 
computing facilities for brain-related research. The project is funded by the EU and the Human Brain Project 
 
Learning goals: 
•  Run a simple simulation on the EBRAINS BrainScaleS-2 hardware. 
•  Explore the capabilities of BrainScaleS-2 as well as PyNN (https://neuralensemble.org/PyNN) 
 
Tasks: 
1.  Request a free account for the EBRAINS neuromorphic platform at 
https://wiki.ebrains.eu/bin/view/Collabs/neuromorphic/Getting%20access  
2.  Once you have an account and a collab, head over to the BrainScaleS-2 demo code and 
descriptions at https://electronicvisions.github.io/documentation-brainscales2/latest/brainscales2-
demos/tutorial.html    
3.  Pick one of the examples/demos, e.g., matrix multiplication, and run it on the BrainScaleS-2 
hardware: https://electronicvisions.github.io/documentation-brainscales2/latest/brainscales2-
demos/tp_00-introduction.html    
4.  Enjoy the excitement J!
