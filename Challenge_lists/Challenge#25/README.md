Challenge #25: 
Wrape our design with SPI interface

# Introduction to SPI Interface
The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is an important way for software and hardware to communicate with each other. It's particularly valuable because it provides reliable data transmission while using very few pins on the microcontroller - this is crucial since most embedded systems have limited input/output connections available.

# Verilog Implementation
In Verilog, the SPI interface can be simply wrapped up as a module that handles all the communication details. This wrapper would take care of receiving data from the host computer, passing it to our processing core, and sending results back out.
# Current Project Status
However, I'm currently stuck in my Verilog hardware design and haven't been able to finish debugging and wrapping up the SPI implementation. The timing and state machine logic has been more complex than expected, and I've run out of time to properly debug all the issues.
But even without a complete implementation, we can still estimate the performance based on our previous software profiling work and our Verilog design's clock cycle analysis.
# Performance Estimates
#Communication Time: I suspect the SPI interface will take about 2 milliseconds to transmit data in and out of the hardware.

#Software Baseline:From Challenge #9, we profiled our reference software and found it takes an average of 21.877 milliseconds to process each sample (a 16×16 matrix).

#Hardware Processing Time: When the same sample goes through our Verilog code, it should take 476 clock cycles. With our ASIC running at 20 MHz, this works out to: 476 cycles ÷ 20,000,000 Hz ≈ 23.8 microseconds
Speed Improvement Calculation.

This gives us a significant speedup of approximately 919 times faster than the software implementation (21.877 ms ÷ 23.8 μs ≈ 919×), not counting the 2ms SPI communication overhead.
After counting the data transmission through SPI, the total hardware processing time becomes:

Processing time: 23.8 μs
SPI communication time: 2 ms
Total time: 2.024 ms

This results in a more realistic speedup of approximately 10.8 times faster than the software implementation (21.877 ms ÷ 2.024 ms ≈ 10.8×).
While the pure computational speedup is impressive at 919×, the SPI communication overhead significantly impacts the overall system performance, reducing the practical speedup to about 11×. This highlights the importance of considering communication bottlenecks in hardware acceleration projects, where data transfer time can dominate the total execution time despite having extremely fast processing cores.
