Overall Project Goal: Design a functionally correct and verifiable hardware implementation (e.g., in Verilog/SystemVerilog) of a single GPT Transformer Block, suitable for ASIC realization.

Phase 1: Algorithm Understanding & Detailed Specification

Goal 1.1: Thoroughly analyze the target Transformer Block structure from nanoGPT.
Identify every input, output, and internal signal flow.
Note all parameters (e.g., n_embd, n_head, block_size, bias usage).

Goal 1.2: Create a precise mathematical specification for each sub-component of the Block:
Layer Normalization (LN1 & LN2).
Multi-Head (Masked) Self-Attention (MHSA), including Q,K,V projections, scaled dot-product attention, softmax, and output projection.
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) including linear layers and activation function (e.g., GELU).
Residual connections.

Goal 1.3: Define critical design parameters for your ASIC implementation:
Data precision for all calculations (e.g., FP16, BF16, INT8).
Fixed dimensions based on config (e.g., embedding size, head dimension, FFN hidden size).
Goal 1.4 (Optional, but good practice): Establish initial high-level targets for Performance (e.g., throughput, latency), Power, and Area (PPA) for the block.

Phase 2: Hardware Architecture Design for the Transformer Block

Goal 2.1: Develop a high-level block diagram of your Transformer Block ASIC.
Clearly delineate major functional units and data paths.
Goal 2.2: Specify each "Mathematical Operation Unit" required:
Matrix Multiplication Unit(s) (MMUs).
Softmax Unit.
Layer Normalization Unit(s).
Activation Function Unit (e.g., GELU).
Vector/Element-wise Arithmetic Units (for additions, etc.).
Goal 2.3: Define the on-chip memory architecture.
Plan for storage of weights (e.g., W

K
​
 ,W 
V
​
 ,W 
O
​
 ,W

​

​
 ,γ,β).
Plan for storage of activations and intermediate results.
Specify memory types (e.g., SRAM blocks), sizes, and port requirements.
Goal 2.4: Design the data flow and interconnect strategy between all units and memory.
Goal 2.5: Define the top-level I/O signals for your Transformer Block ASIC module (inputs for activations and weights, outputs for processed activations, clock, reset, control).
Phase 3: Design & Implementation of Mathematical Operation Units

Goal 3.1: For each identified Mathematical Operation Unit (MMU, Softmax, LayerNorm, etc.):
Sub-Goal 3.1.1: Design the internal "ALU" components: detailed architecture of adders, subtractors, multipliers, MAC units, comparators, shifters, and specialized logic for operations like division, square root, exponentiation, tailored to the chosen data precision.
Sub-Goal 3.1.2: Implement the unit in HDL (Verilog/SystemVerilog).
Sub-Goal 3.1.3: Develop a comprehensive unit-level testbench and rigorously verify its functional correctness against mathematical models or software equivalents.
Phase 4: FSM and Control Logic Design & Implementation

Goal 4.1: Design and implement FSMs for controlling multi-cycle operations within complex Mathematical Operation Units (e.g., the sequence of steps for Layer Normalization, Softmax, or iterative arithmetic operations).
Goal 4.2: Design and implement the top-level Control Unit (likely FSM-based) for the entire Transformer Block.
This unit will orchestrate the overall sequence: LN 
1
​
 →MHSA→Res 
1
​
 →LN 
2
​
 →FFN→Res 
2
​
 .
It will manage start/done handshaking with the mathematical units and control data movement.
Goal 4.3: Verify the FSMs and control logic, initially in isolation and then in conjunction with simplified datapath models.
Phase 5: Integration and Top-Level Block Verification

Goal 5.1: Integrate all designed Mathematical Operation Units, memory interfaces/models, and control logic into the complete Transformer Block HDL design.
Goal 5.2: Develop a comprehensive top-level testbench for the entire Transformer Block.
This testbench should be able to provide inputs (initial activations, weights) and compare the ASIC block's output with a golden reference (e.g., output from your nanoGPT software model for the same inputs and configuration).
Goal 5.3: Perform rigorous simulation and functional verification of the integrated block.
Goal 5.4: Debug any discrepancies and iterate on the design until functional correctness is achieved.
Phase 6: Preparation for Synthesis (Next Steps post-functional design)

Goal 6.1: Prepare initial timing constraints and design constraints for synthesis.
Goal 6.2 (Stretch Goal for this phase): Perform a trial logic synthesis to get initial estimates of area, timing, and power for your Transformer block design. Analyze reports and identify potential critical paths or areas for optimization.
