vlib work

 vsim -voptargs="+acc" lif_neuron_tb

add wave -r /*
run -all

use gpt to write system verilog code is pain

I want to say actually should be easy coding, but my way of vibe coding seems always generate me the wrong result

GPT always generate strange bit shifting result as I scale my bits result. 

Suffering greatly from verilator simulation. simulation makes no sense.

I think I should allow more bits input then we can so called a input
