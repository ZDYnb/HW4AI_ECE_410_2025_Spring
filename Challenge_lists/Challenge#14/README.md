• Write a CUDA kernel that computes the Fibonacci sequence for N numbers. E.g., N = 220.
• The Fibonacci sequence is a famous mathematical sequence where each number is the sum of
the two preceding ones. It starts with 0 and 1, and continues as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,
34, 55, 89, 144, ...
• The mathematical definition is:
• F(0) = 0
• F(1) = 1
• F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for N-2 ³ n > 1
• Compare a simple sequential implementation with your CUDA implementation. What do you
observe?
